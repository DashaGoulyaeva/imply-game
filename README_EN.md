# What is this project?

**Imply** is a small browser game about associations and imagination.

Every day, five abstract images created by AI appear.  
The player looks at them and chooses the one whose atmosphere ("vibe") feels closest.

There is no single correct interpretation. The game is about how different people find meaning in the same images and how intuition leads to different choices.

## Why this project exists

This project is a calm experiment.

It is not about winning, scores, or speed.  
It is about:

*   ambiguity
*   intuition
*   personal associations
*   contemplation

## Current status

**The project is alive and growing.** The game's core is functional.

Right now:
*   Fully automatic **generation of the "pictures of the day"** (5 unique AI images).
*   A minimalist **web interface** to view the cards and make a choice.
*   A simple **backend** that saves the player's choice.
*   The main focus is the **gradual development** of the idea and mechanics.

## How it works (the idea)

1.  The system automatically generates **five abstract pictures** by combining concepts from dictionaries.
2.  The pictures are displayed on the page as the **"cards of the day"**.
3.  The player chooses **one card** that resonates with their mood.
4.  The choice is saved. *(Soon, AI feedback and community stats will appear here.)*

## Tech

At the beginning:
*   HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)
*   Python (generation logic and backend)
*   Stable Diffusion (image generation)

Later (maybe):
*   LLM integration (AI host)
*   Basic statistics
*   Hosting

**Nothing complex on purpose.**

## Rules for myself

*   Build slowly
*   Keep things simple
*   Finish small steps
*   No pressure to monetize or scale
*   The project is allowed to change direction
