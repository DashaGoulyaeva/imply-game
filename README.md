# What is this project?

This is a small browser game based on associations and imagination.

An abstract image is generated by AI from a single word.
The player looks at the image and tries to guess the original word.

There is no single correct interpretation.
The game is about how different people see meaning in the same image.

## Why this project exists

This project is an experiment.

It is not about winning, scores, or speed.
It is about:
- ambiguity
- intuition
- personal associations
- calm interaction

The goal is to build a simple, soulful game that lives between images and words.

## Current status

The project is at a very early stage.

Right now:
- the repository contains only basic files
- there is no working game yet
- the focus is on learning and building step by step

This is expected and intentional.

## Planned idea (high level)

1. AI generates an abstract image based on a word
2. The image is shown on a web page
3. The player types a guess
4. The game shows whether the guess matches the original word
5. Optionally, the player sees how others guessed

## Tech (will grow over time)

At the beginning:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Later (maybe):
- a simple backend
- an AI image generation API
- basic hosting

Nothing complex on purpose.

## Rules for myself

- Build slowly
- Keep things simple
- Finish small steps
- No pressure to monetize or scale
- The project is allowed to change direction

## Notes

This README is written for a beginner.
It will be updated as the project grows.
